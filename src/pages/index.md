# Welcome to eXplicit Scrum (XS) ðŸš€

## Introduction

eXplicit Scrum (XS) is a tailored version of Scrum, designed to be fully utilized by companies of all sizes. We understand that many organizations want to reap the full benefits of Scrum, but often find it challenging due to a myriad of reasons. XS is here to address this gap.

## Our Motto

"A place for everything, everything in its place."

This motto encapsulates our belief in having a specific and clear-cut approach in the Scrum process, leaving no room for ambiguity.

## Why eXplicit Scrum?

The original Scrum Guide, while being a great starting point, can be generic and vague in certain areas. XS takes inspiration from it, but aims to provide explicit and comprehensive guidelines that should be followed without modifications.

### Challenges in Implementing Scrum

Organizations often struggle with the implementation of Scrum due to a number of reasons:

- **Ambiguities in the Scrum Guide**: The Scrum Guide, while being an excellent foundational document, often leaves a lot to interpretation. This can lead to confusion and inconsistent application of Scrum principles.

- **Misinformation on the Web**: The internet is full of resources, but not all are accurate or helpful. Misinformation about Scrum can lead to a misunderstanding of its core principles and how to effectively apply them.

- **Premature Tailoring**: Many organizations attempt to tailor Scrum to their specific needs too soon, without fully understanding or implementing its core principles. This can lead to ineffective practices that don't yield the desired benefits.

- **Vagueness in the Scrum Guide**: Certain areas in the Scrum Guide are intentionally left vague to allow for adaptability. However, without proper knowledge and experience, this can lead to misinterpretation and incorrect application.

XS addresses these issues by providing a more explicit set of guidelines. Once a user passes a set of criteria, they are allowed to start making modifications to better suit their specific needs. This ensures that the core principles of Scrum are adhered to, while allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
