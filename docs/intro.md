# Welcome to eXplicit Scrum (XS) ðŸš€

## Introduction

eXplicit Scrum (XS) is a tailored version of Scrum, designed to be fully utilized by companies of all sizes. We understand that many organizations want to reap the full benefits of Scrum, but often find it challenging due to a myriad of reasons. XS is here to address this gap.

## Our Motto

"A place for everything, everything in its place."

This motto encapsulates our belief in having a specific and clear-cut approach in the Scrum process, leaving no room for ambiguity.

## Why eXplicit Scrum?

The original Scrum Guide, while being a great starting point, can be generic and vague in certain areas. XS takes inspiration from it, but aims to provide explicit and comprehensive guidelines that should be followed without modifications.

Once a user passes a set of criteria, they are allowed to start making modifications to better suit their specific needs. This ensures that the core principles of Scrum are adhered to, while allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
