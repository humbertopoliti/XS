# Sprint Review

## Introduction

The Sprint Review is an essential part of Scrum, the iterative and incremental Agile software development framework. It serves as a platform to inspect the increment of product development and adapt the Product Backlog, if needed.

The Sprint Review is designed to be the central meeting for exchanging information with stakeholders. It is meant to create transparency, gather feedback, and foster collaboration. If the Sprint Review is conducted effectively, it should be the primary (if not the only) meeting necessary for this purpose. Other meetings with stakeholders should be limited and only arranged if absolutely necessary, in order to respect the time and focus of the Scrum Team.

Holding this single meeting at the same time every Sprint brings several benefits:

1. **Predictability:** Stakeholders can plan their schedules around the regular meeting time, increasing the likelihood of their consistent participation.
2. **Efficiency:** By consolidating discussions and decision-making into one meeting, the team can reduce time spent on meeting preparation, context-switching, and disruptions to their workflow.
3. **Transparency and Trust:** Regular, scheduled reviews demonstrate the team's commitment to transparency and can help build trust with stakeholders.
4. **Continuity and Momentum:** A consistent meeting rhythm can help maintain momentum and foster a sense of progress and continuity for the team and stakeholders.


## ðŸš© Red Flag

A key part of the Sprint Review is gathering feedback from stakeholders. Their insights are crucial to adapting the Product Backlog and ensuring the product is evolving to meet the needs of the end users.

If you notice that no stakeholders are attending the Sprint Review meetings, this is a major red flag. The lack of stakeholder involvement in Sprint Reviews renders these meetings pointless, as the team misses out on crucial feedback and the opportunity for valuable collaboration.

In such cases, the issue should be escalated promptly. The team, along with the organization's leadership, needs to evaluate the reasons behind the lack of stakeholder participation. It's also important to question whether Scrum is the right approach for your project if stakeholder engagement is consistently low.

Remember, Scrum is a framework that thrives on feedback and iterative progress. Without active stakeholder involvement, the benefits of Scrum are significantly reduced.


## Definition of Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is an informal get-together at the end of each Sprint where the Scrum Team and stakeholders take a look at the product increment created during the Sprint. It's a friendly, collaborative space where everyone can provide feedback that might shape the direction of the next Sprint.

## Requirements for Sprint Review

Before the Sprint Review starts, make sure the following requirements are met:

1. **Product Increment:** A "Done" increment should be ready for review. It should be in a usable condition and meet the "Definition of Done" set by the team.
2. **Attendees:** All required participants (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team, and Stakeholders) should be invited and their attendance confirmed.
3. **Agenda:** An agenda for the meeting should be prepared and shared with all participants. This should include time for presenting the increment, gathering feedback, and discussing next steps.
4. **Prepared Demonstration:** The Development Team should prepare a demonstration of the work completed during the Sprint. This can include a walkthrough of the product increment or a presentation of the key features developed.
5. **Updated Product Backlog:** The Product Owner should update the Product Backlog and be ready to discuss potential completion dates based on the team's progress.
6. **Venue & Tools:** Ensure the meeting room (or video call link for remote teams) is booked and ready. All necessary tools for presentation and collaboration (projector, whiteboard, digital collaboration tools etc.) should be prepared and tested.
7. **Feedback Mechanism:** Have a process in place to record feedback and suggestions from stakeholders during the meeting.


## Participants

The Sprint Review meeting involves:

1. **Product Owner:** Responsible for explaining what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what have not.
2. **Development Team:** Presents the work done, and discusses the challenges faced during the Sprint.
3. **Scrum Master:** In eXplicit Scrum, there is no permanent Scrum Master role. The Scrum Master duties are rotated among team members each Sprint. The person serving as Scrum Master for the current Sprint assists in organizing the meeting, with the option to facilitate if needed.
4. **Stakeholders:** Invited by the Product Owner to provide feedback about the product increment.



## Meeting Flow

Here's the flow of what should happen in the Sprint Review meeting:

1. **Review of the Sprint Goal:** The **Product Owner** starts by reminding everyone of the Sprint Goal and the context in which the team was working.
2. **Review of the Done Items:** The Development Team goes through and demonstrates the functionality of the "Done" Product Backlog items. No demo is needed if none of the "Done" items are easy to demonstrate. Showcase any impact of the work as well:
3. **Product Backlog Update:** The Product Owner provides an updated status of the Product Backlog and projects likely completion dates based on the team's progress.
4. **Stakeholder Feedback:** Stakeholders provide feedback and suggestions which could lead to the addition or modification of items in the Product Backlog.
5. **Review of the Timeline, Budget, and Capabilities:** Discussion and review of the timeline, budget, marketplace, and potential use of the product.
6. **Adjustment of the Product Backlog:** The Product Owner, with the help of the feedback, may choose to adjust the Product Backlog items and their priority.
7. **Closing the Meeting:** The Scrum Master closes the meeting by summarizing the outcomes and action items, and confirms the time and date of the next Scrum events.

## Meeting Output

By the end of the Sprint Review, we should have answers to these questions:

1. **Revised Product Backlog:** What changes, improvements, or new requirements have emerged that need to be reflected in the Product Backlog?
2. **Product Increment Acceptance:** Does the increment meet the Product Owner's "Definition of Done" and is it in a usable condition?
3. **Next Sprint Planning Inputs:** What decisions have been made about the next Sprint, including the composition and order of the Product Backlog?
4. **Transparency:** Do all participants have a shared understanding of the state of the product and any challenges the team is facing?


Remember, the main goal of the Sprint Review is to ensure transparency, gather feedback, and adapt to improve the product continuously. It's not just a demonstration of what has been achieved but a platform for collaboration and continuous improvement.
