# Principles & Practices

The eXplicit Scrum Principles & Practices are based on the Scrum values, but aim to remove ambiguities and set clear principles that need to be followed.





## Scrum Values

The Scrum framework emphasizes five core values, which all participants in Scrum should embrace:

1. **Commitment:** Each team member is dedicated to the success of the team and the completion of the team's goals.

2. **Courage:** Scrum team members have the bravery to face challenges, ask tough questions, and stand up for what they believe is right.

3. **Focus:** Everyone concentrates on the work of the current Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.

4. **Openness:** Team members and stakeholders are honest and transparent about their work and the challenges they face.

5. **Respect:** Scrum team members respect each other's abilities and individualities, valuing the diverse skills and perspectives within the team.

3. **No Distractions:** Echoing the value of **Focus**, eXplicit Scrum emphasizes a working environment free from unnecessary distractions, enabling the team to concentrate fully on the Sprint Goals. The clarity of eXplicit Scrum minimizes process ambiguity, allowing team members to focus less on the process and more on delivering value.

4. **Transparency & Honesty:** Rooted in the value of **Openness**, eXplicit Scrum encourages a culture of transparency and honesty, fostering trust and clear communication among team members and stakeholders. eXplicit Scrum itself strives for transparency in every guideline it sets, explaining the reasoning behind each one.
